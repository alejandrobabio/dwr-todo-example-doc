# About

I was wondering if this gem could be a good tool for building applications. Then, I decided to make one to check it out. It was a process of research and learning that became into this document. Which was completed with all the steps to make an application super simple and at the same time functional enough to get an idea of what dry-web-roda can offer.

Most of it is the result of using the ideas and examples of the documentation of dry-rb, rom-rb, roda, the berg application, Icelab's blog, and everything I found on the web. And with that, I built the best app I could to share what I had learned. Although I am happy with the result, I think it can be improved, so it will surely evolve.

Thank you.
